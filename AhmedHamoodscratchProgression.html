<br> <h3> <Center> <Span style="color:black"> To start off my scratch project, I decided to go with an adventure game in space, hence I created space adventure. A simple game played in a simple way, but has its own creative aspects like personalization and an infinite mode. But the modes will be done another day. I created basic scripts for changing costumes and backgrounds, then assigning them to different sprites. The hardest part was the movement for my hero as I had to learn each operator first.  </span> </Center> </h3>

<br> <h3> <Center> <Span style="color:black"> To make the menu more concise and fluent I added small transition operators which helped me get to the mode selector. Because I knew that infinite mode wasn’t enough I decided to add a level to increase the number of interactions you can make. I added scripts for pressing buttons and I started to pick me death objects, which were separated in each mode. Then I decided to colour them a shade of red, black, purple, or even leave them blank as they were.  </span> </Center> </h3>

<br> <h3> <Center> <Span style="color:black"> On day three, I started my sound cues to enhance the background of my game. To start with I put sound cues in every brand  new screen, then I tested out different sounds and tested the pitch change operator. After perfecting my sounds, I started working with the infinite mode. I added my Antiheros which spawned at different times and moved to random locations in a certain axis. Making use of the variables I added my points to my operators and then assigned them to “+1” to stars when touching the hero. </span> </Center> </h3>

<br> <h3> <Center> <Span style="color:black"> On the final day, I started the level mode which was the only thing left. I had to create all new Anti-heroes which had different variations of balls instead of rocks. After designing, I gave them the same code as the infinite anti heroes but, the end game wasn’t the same. As I added an endgame2 message to be broadcasted, telling the user that it’s game over and you have to start from the menu again. This was done by removing the restart button. But also, there's an end goal so I added a you win sprite with similar operators to the endgame2 sprite. I made the final goal of collecting 5 stars which only spawns in a specific amount of time.  </span> </Center> </h3>

            <td bgcolor= black style="color:#FFFFFF;"> When you go near the white rocket I want you to reflect the exact way you came from, so if you were to hit the front of the rocket you would be pushed forward an equal amount. There was no operator to do that, So I had to get creative and use sensing to make you move an equal amount to the result hit. </td>

            <td bgcolor= black style="color:#FFFFFF;"> The restart button would make everything stop but freeze for a while. The only way I could have fixed this button is by adding a delay so less items are frozen when you restart. Making the restarting almost perfect. </td>

<h3> <Center> <Span style="color:black"> For the next time I would start off by introducing a pair of instructions on the screen or making a control setting allowing you to see the controls and maybe switch from w,a,s, and d to the arrow keys. Also, I would like to increase the amount of levels instead of one. I could add maybe a random terrain generator, which would spawn random antiheros and give you a random but realistic star goal which would be displayed on the top right hand corner. As of the infinite mode, I would like more antiheros and power-ups giving you specific boosts for a certain amount of time. </span> </Center> </h3>

 This Assignment has helped me improve the ideology of systems of operations and helped me start visualizing how to put the missing pieces of code together. I also have started to learn how to organize a website properly, helping me in grade 12 computer science and in future web development classes for software engineering. I also have started to learn embedding which is a big part of web development for the future. Last, as things turn out this assignment has helped me build the fundamentals of using basic codes and really start my coding journey!
